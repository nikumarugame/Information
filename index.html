Your continued use of the Game after such modifications constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms[4].

6. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Game at any time, without prior notice, if you violate any of these Terms, or if we determine that your use of the Game is harmful to us, other users, or third parties. You may also terminate your use of the Game at any time by uninstalling the Game from your device.

Sections 3 (Intellectual Property), 7 (Disclaimer of Warranties), 8 (Limitation of Liability), 9 (Governing Law), and 10 (Miscellaneous) shall survive termination.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such provision, and shall not affect our right to enforce such provision in the future. You may not assign these Terms or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to any third party without our prior written permission. We may assign these Terms to any third party at our discretion.

Privacy Policy

1. Introduction

At nikumarugames studio ("We", "Us" or "Our"), we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal information when you use our casual Word game (the "Game") on iOS devices. By downloading, installing, or using the Game, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy complies with Apple’s App Store Privacy Guidelines, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (if applicable), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) (if applicable), and other applicable privacy laws and regulations. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will notify you of any material changes by updating the Game or posting a notice within the Game. Your continued use of the Game after such modifications constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy[3].

2. Information We Collect

As a simple casual game, we collect minimal information to ensure the Game’s normal operation and improve your user experience. We do not collect any unnecessary personal information, and we will never collect sensitive information such as your credit card details, address, or phone number without your explicit consent. The information we collect falls into the following categories:

2.1 Non-Personal Information

We may collect non-personal information that does not identify you individually, including but not limited to:

- Device information: Such as your iOS device model, operating system version, device ID (non-identifiable), and screen resolution;

- Game usage data: Such as your gameplay progress, scores, levels completed, time spent in the Game, and interactions with the Game’s features (e.g., number of hints used);

- Technical information: Such as crash reports, error logs, and network connection status, which help us identify and fix bugs, improve the Game’s performance, and enhance user experience.

This non-personal information is collected automatically when you use the Game, and is aggregated and anonymized so that it cannot be used to identify you individually.

2.2 Personal Information

We only collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us, and only when necessary to provide the Game’s services or improve your experience. The personal information we may collect includes:

- Apple ID information: If you choose to sign in to the Game using your Apple ID (optional), we may collect your Apple ID nickname and profile picture (if you permit), solely for the purpose of displaying your identity within the Game (e.g., for leaderboards, if applicable);

- Contact information: If you choose to contact us for support, feedback, or inquiries, we may collect your email address, which you provide voluntarily, to respond to your requests;

- In-App Purchase information: If you make In-App Purchases, Apple will process your payment information (e.g., credit card details) directly, and we will not collect or store any of your payment information. We may only receive confirmation of the purchase (e.g., purchase ID, item purchased) from Apple, to verify and fulfill your In-App Purchase.

2.3 Information Collected by Third Parties

We may use third-party tools or services to help us operate, analyze, or improve the Game. These third parties may collect non-personal information (and, in some cases, personal information, if you permit) in accordance with their own privacy policies. We do not control these third parties, and are not responsible for their data collection or use practices. The third parties we may use include:

- Analytics tools: Such as Firebase Analytics or Google Analytics, which collect non-personal information about Game usage to help us understand user behavior and improve the Game;

- Ad services (if applicable): If the Game includes ads, third-party ad providers may collect non-personal information to display relevant ads. You can opt out of personalized ads through your iOS device settings (Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking);

- Apple services: Apple may collect information about your use of the Game in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy, including but not limited to download and purchase history. We do not have access to this information unless you explicitly permit it.

Pursuant to Apple’s latest App Store审核指南, we will not share any of your personal information with third-party AI services without your explicit consent and clear disclosure of the purpose and recipient of the data sharing.

3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect (both personal and non-personal) solely for the following purposes, and will not use your information for any other purposes without your explicit consent:

- To provide and maintain the Game’s services: Including enabling you to play the Game, save your gameplay progress, and access In-App Purchases;

- To improve the Game: Using non-personal information (e.g., gameplay data, crash reports) to identify bugs, optimize performance, add new features, and tailor the Game to user preferences;

- To respond to your requests: Using your contact information (e.g., email address) to respond to your support inquiries, feedback, or complaints;

- To verify and fulfill In-App Purchases: Using purchase confirmation information from Apple to ensure you receive the In-App Purchases you have paid for;

- To display your identity within the Game: If you sign in with your Apple ID, using your nickname and profile picture to identify you in leaderboards or other social features (if applicable);

- To comply with legal obligations: If required by law, regulation, or court order, we may use or disclose your information to comply with such obligations.

4. How We Disclose Your Information

We will never sell, rent, or lease your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes. We may disclose your information only in the following circumstances:

- With your explicit consent: We will disclose your personal information to a third party only if you have given us your explicit consent to do so;

- To third-party service providers: We may disclose non-personal information (and, in some cases, personal information, if necessary) to third-party service providers who help us operate, analyze, or improve the Game (e.g., analytics tools, ad services). These third parties are bound by confidentiality agreements and are prohibited from using your information for any purpose other than providing the services we request;

- To comply with legal obligations: We may disclose your information if required by law, regulation, court order, or other legal process, or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of other users or third parties;

- In the event of a merger or acquisition: If we are merged with, acquired by, or sell all or part of our assets to another company, we may disclose your information to the acquiring company, but the acquiring company will be bound by this Privacy Policy (or a similar privacy policy) to protect your information;

- Anonymized or aggregated data: We may disclose anonymized and aggregated non-personal information (e.g., total number of users, average gameplay time) to third parties for research, marketing, or other legitimate purposes, as this data cannot be used to identify you individually.

5. How We Protect Your Information

We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction. These measures include:

- Technical security measures: Using encryption, firewalls, and secure servers to protect your personal information stored on our systems;

- Limited access: Only authorized personnel have access to your personal information, and they are required to comply with our confidentiality obligations;

- Data minimization: Collecting only the information necessary to provide the Game’s services, and anonymizing non-personal information;

- Compliance with Apple’s security guidelines: Following Apple’s best practices for data security and privacy, including using Apple’s secure APIs for data transmission and storage.

However, no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information, and you acknowledge that there is a risk of unauthorized access to your information when using the Game. You shall be responsible for maintaining the security of your iOS device and your access to the Game.

6. Your Rights Regarding Your Information

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including but not limited to the right to access, correct, delete, or export your personal information, and the right to opt out of certain data collection or use.

7. Data Retention

We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by applicable law. Once your personal information is no longer needed, we will delete it or anonymize it so that it cannot be used to identify you.

Non-personal information (e.g., aggregated gameplay data) may be retained indefinitely, for the purpose of improving the Game and providing better services to users.

8. Children’s Privacy

The Game is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
